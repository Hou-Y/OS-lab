Illustrate the characteristics, differences and typical use of the system calls fork, execve, and system. 

System call fork creates a new process called child keeping the former (now called father) which starts from the next operation that generates the process
Every child inherits the father's characteristics and has its own stack of memory for variables unlike threads that has shared pointers

execve jumps to the command specified 
???

system is like a fork with the child executing execve and the parent continuing with his process
