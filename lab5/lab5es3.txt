Execute the following operation with the find command:

    Print the list of the files in the tree with root / that have extension “.exe”, dimension greater than 1024 bytes, and that they are executable.
    Print the path of all the files with extension “.c”, and with a dimension of 100 bytes.
    Print all the files of your user, of regular type, that contain in the name at least one a and at least one A in an undefined order (i.e., a…A or A…a). Of these files print the last 3 lines.
    Print all the files of your user from the level of depth 3 to the level of depth 5, with a dimension of at least 250 bytes, and with the name of exactly 4 characters. Of these files count the number of characters. Repeat the same operation counting the number of rows.
    Print all the files in the system with an extension of 3 characters, with the name beginning with an A and with 3 consecutive z. Of these files create a compressed version (see the manual, man, of the command gzip).
    Print the content of all the directories, starting from the root of the file system, and with name bin.
    Find all the files with the extension .c of the other users (excluding your user!), and belonging to your group.
    Modify the permissions of all your files in the first level of the sub-tree of the root of the file system, so that all users other than the owner have no permission.
